HopeLine
Welcome to HopeLine, a platform designed to connect people in need with donors who can help. Whether youâ€™re looking for assistance or you want to give back, HopeLine makes it easy to request or donate essential items.

Features
Request Help: Users can submit requests for items such as food, clothing, and other essentials in the Request Help section.
Donate: Donors can view and fulfill requests in the Donate section.
Users are encouraged to explore the platform and even create test ("fake") requests while the project is under development.
Notes
After submitting a request, it may take up to 30 seconds for the request to appear due to API processing. Please avoid spamming the submit button.
Current requests are stored in a database. Any test requests will be periodically deleted as the platform evolves.
Updates
We are actively working on enhancing HopeLine with more features and improvements. Stay tuned for upcoming updates that will make the platform even more user-friendly and impactful.
