            <p>Welcome to HopeLine! This is a platform where you can request small items like food, clothing, and other essentials in the <strong>Request Help</strong> section, or donate items in the <strong>Donate</strong> section. Whether you need help or want to contribute, you can be part of making a difference.</p>
            <p>Feel free to create "fake" requests for now. Don't worry; I will delete them from the database later. Updates on the project are coming soon, and we're continuously improving the platform to make it easier to help those in need.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> After submitting a request, it may take up to 30 seconds for the request to go through because of the API. Please do not spam the submit button as it may cause issues with your request being processed.</p>
